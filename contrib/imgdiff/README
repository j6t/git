This directory contains facilities that allow to highlight changes
between two images.

Prerequisites
-------------

ImageMagick - http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php


Installation
------------

Copy the file imgdiff into a directory that is in your PATH


Usage
-----

Activate imgdiff in your repository

a.	Define a custom diff driver:

		$ git config diff.imgdiff.command imgdiff

b.	Use the custom driver for your images, i.e. put
	a line like this in your .git/info/attributes:

			*.png	diff=imgdiff

Since this uses ImageMagick behind the scenes, all image formats
are supported that your ImageMagick installation supports.

You can also run the program from the command line like this:

	$ imgdiff pictureold.png picturenew.png
